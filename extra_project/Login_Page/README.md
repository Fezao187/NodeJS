# Improving my JavaScript login page

For my JavaScript project, I created a login page
using local storage to store my user data. Now in this projectm, I am going to improve it by implementing NodeJS into my login page and everything will be saved to the MongoDB database.

# Progress:
    * The create account page is working as intended, a user can create an account and it gets saved to the database.
    * The login page is working as intended, the user can login and retrieve data from the database.

# TODO:
    * Work on the reset password page, retrieve data from the database then update the password.
    * Add a page to show the user that they have logged in.
    * Add a button to allow the user to log out once logged in.
